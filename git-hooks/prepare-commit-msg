# A prepare-commit-message hook that makes it illegal to commit using the '-m'
# flag. Developers should commit normally or use '--amend' instead, in order
# to pick up the commit template. An exception is made for 'arc', which
# is the preferred workflow.
#
# For emergencies, you can override this hook prefixing your command with
# a `NOHOOK=1` environment variable, e.g.:
#
#     NOHOOK=1 git commit -m "yoloswag420"

# 'arc' will set this ARCANIST environment variable while it runs a command
#
# $NOHOOK allows skipping of all hooks including prepare-commit-msg, which
# does not support skipping via the --no-verify flag, unfortunately.
