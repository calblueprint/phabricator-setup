# For emergencies, you can override this hook by using either
#
#     git push --no-verify [...]
#
# OR by prefixing your command with a `NOHOOK=1` environment
# variable, e.g.:
#
#     NOHOOK=1 git push [...]

# 'arc' will set this ARCANIST environment variable while it runs a command
#
# $NOHOOK allows skipping of all hooks including prepare-commit-msg, which
# does not support skipping via the --no-verify flag, unfortunately.
